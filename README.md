Snakemake Workflows
===================
An experimental repo with
[Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake) rules and
workflows for Next Generation Sequencing, specifically for metagenomics.  The
directory structure is similar to
[snakemake-workflows](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake-workflows)
from the Snakemake author himself so it may later be merged once the rules
prove useful.
