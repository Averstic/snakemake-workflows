Snakemake Workflows
===================
An experimental repo with [Snakemake] rules and workflows for Next Generation
Sequencing, specifically for metagenomics.  The directory structure is similar
to [snakemake-workflows] from the Snakemake author himself so it may later be
merged once the rules prove useful.


Requirements
============
- [Snakemake] version 3.1

[Snakemake]: https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake
[Snakemake-workflows]: https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake
